This folder contains code of an app used to evaluate placement of warehouses. 

By the time you're reading this, the app is not deployed in Heroku due to `mlrose` (an optimization library) not working properly on Heroku.

However, if you want to go through the trouble of installing the dependencies on your own, `mlrose` will work properly in your localhost.

Thank you for your understanding.
